# react-tests
### Expect this repository to have broken non working code in it most of the time.

Every project I do where I'm teaching myself react will be placed in it's own folder inside the 'Examples' directory. This allows me to use different tooling (if I had a universal package.json file, it would get pretty large, pretty quick), mostly I'm doing this because I might want to use webpack instead of gulp, or grunt instead of gulp etc.

Every project should have it's own README with information about the build process, and running the app. Mostly it should be `npm install` and then check whether I used webpack or gulp.

## Technologies that will be used throughout:
* [ReactJS](http://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/)
* [Reflux](https://github.com/reflux/refluxjs)
* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
* [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
* [React-Router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router)
* [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)
* [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/)
